## ðŸ“– About 

NFM is a 3D animation tool designed to modernize more traditional animation workflows, especially in the context of machinima. Planned features include:
- A non-destructive, layer-based animation workflow
- A cutting-edge 3D renderer with wholly dynamic lighting
- An extensible asset system that can support arbitrary file formats, including other games

Note that this project is still in early development, and it's goals are continually in flux.

## âš  Status

While this project has been in development for more than a year in various forms, NFM is still *far* from feature-complete and is not ready to be used in production.

## ðŸ’¡ Licence

NFM is licenced under the [MIT licence](LICENSE.md).
